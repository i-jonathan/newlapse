# NewLapse
This replaces chronolapse on linux

## Usage
```bash
newlapse -capture -rate 10 -folder "recording"
newlapse -crop -folder "recording"
newlapse -convert -fps 20
```
You can also do the following
```bash
newlapse -ccc -rate 5 -fps 10 -folder "tmp"
```
which will capture a picture of the screen every 5 seconds, and save it in the ./tmp folder.
if you CTRL+C it will start cropping the pictures and convert each screen into a mp4 file.

On a mac with retina display you will need to write a config file. First you have to figure out how big the ```screencapture``` pictures are. In my case 2800x1800. Then you ```echo "2800x1800+0+0" > config.txt"```. When cropping you just provide ```newlapse -crop -config "config.txt"```.
